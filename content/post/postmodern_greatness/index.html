<p><strong>The fear of death follows from the fear of life. The man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time. Author unknown</strong></p>
<p>Do you know the band Bloc Party? Their songs are anthems of motivation — fast, hard, and exploding with guitar feedback and the lead singer’s gritty East London accent.</p>
<p>Recently some friends and I went to see a Bloc Party concert, featuring all the songs from their most famous 2005 album, Silent Alarm. I felt sad and a little sorry for the band to realise that 12 years ago, they would have occupied a stadium 3 times this size. About halfway through the set they played A song for Clay and it starts like this:</p>
<p><strong>I am trying to be heroic, in an age of, modernity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am trying to be heroic, because all around me, history sings.</strong></p>
<p>When I heard these lines I realised something.</p>
<p>Human greatness is becoming increasingly rare and difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>In the age of Netflix, Facebook, Candycrush and everything else, being a great human being might seem obsolete and pointless. Another thing to be sarcastic about. But is it?</p>
<p>I watch a series called Poldark, which is set in 18th century Cornwall, England. It begins when Poldark—an English soldier returned from the war in America, arrives home to find his father dead and his estate in ruins. He is destitute, except for owning a couple of derelict mines, and despite being a member of the British nobility by birth.</p>
<p>In the face of adversity he must provide not only for his family, but also for the impoverished miners and tenants under his jurisdiction. So Poldark’s journey towards greatness unfolds, and in this spirit, I would like to offer some unripe musings on the pillars of a great existence:</p>
<div id="willingness-to-risk-poverty-reputation-damage-or-death" class="section level1">
<h1>Willingness to risk poverty, reputation damage or death</h1>
<p>To build an extraordinary life, for yourself or others, you need to be willing to put yourself on the line. Curiously, it seems like the more fully we live, the less we fear dying — perhaps because our regrets are already dead.</p>
</div>
<div id="presence-under-pressure" class="section level1">
<h1>Presence under pressure</h1>
<p>Having true poise under pressure is marker of greatness. I’m not talking about pseudo calmness, but true mindfulness. When great people are under siege they don?t think about the future. They take a microscope to the present moment. They lean into whatever is happening, they scrutinise it, enjoy it, relish it, bathe in it. Whatever exists in this moment—however adverse—is bearable and manageable. The hypothetical catastrophes in our mind are unbearable and unmanageable.</p>
</div>
<div id="tolerance-of-uncertainty" class="section level1">
<h1>Tolerance of uncertainty</h1>
<p>Expecting and living with flux and change — not waiting for the re-emergence of certainty.</p>
<p><strong>My life is precious for being less certain. Poldark</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="working-on-behalf-of-something-bigger-than-yourself" class="section level1">
<h1>Working on behalf of something bigger than yourself</h1>
<p>The great accomplishments are rarely undertaken purely in the interests of the accomplisher. Renewed strength comes from representing and fighting for people that you care about deeply.</p>
</div>
<div id="channelling-anger-into-productive-action" class="section level1">
<h1>Channelling anger into productive action</h1>
<p>When backed into a corner, great people feel their anger viscerally and use it to drive powerful action. They don’t back away from their emotion but listen to it and use it.</p>
</div>
<div id="having-a-clear-ideal" class="section level1">
<h1>Having a clear ideal</h1>
<p>I’ve been criticised more than once for being too idealistic. But I don’t buy it. Most great achievements are carried out in the service of an intrinsically meaningful ideal, whether secular or spiritual. The ideal has to be specific, and deeply rooted in personal interest.</p>
</div>
<div id="action-action-action" class="section level1">
<h1>Action! Action! Action!</h1>
<p>Great people act. They act now, they act later, they just act. As you might have heard, there is a reason why the ideas guy isn’t the CEO. Achievement is about acting often — infusing your life constantly with bite-sized morsels of inspired action.</p>
</div>
<div id="willingness-to-decide-quickly-and-cut-ties" class="section level1">
<h1>Willingness to decide quickly and cut ties</h1>
<p>Great people make decisions crisply and follow through with them promptly. They also recognise that good decisions sometimes incur an emotional cost?and they are willing to live with that cost. There is rarely such a thing as a pain-free decision. So it?s important to stop expecting the perfect (unconsidered) solution to magically come along.</p>
</div>
<div id="no-second-guessing" class="section level1">
<h1>No second-guessing</h1>
<p>A corollary of good decision-making is not second guessing oneself once the decision is made. Either recognise you?ve made the wrong choice and change it straight away or commit fully to what you?ve done. To live in purgatory is to live in hell.</p>
</div>
<div id="perfection-is-the-enemy-willingness-to-fail" class="section level1">
<h1>Perfection is the enemy (&amp; willingness to fail)</h1>
<p>Perfect things take too long to create. A great perspective prioritises work completed over work perfected. Strings of failures create thread for success.</p>
</div>
