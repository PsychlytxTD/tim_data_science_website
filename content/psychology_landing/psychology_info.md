After scheduling, Tim will send you some brief documents to complete, including a consent form and intake questionnaire. At the first session, he will work with you respectfully and openly to develop a shared understanding of the difficulties you have been experiencing. From this point, Tim will support you in moving towards personal goals that are intrinsically meaningful. Depending on the person, goals may include taking some kind of action or simply feeling more peaceful and free inside. People usually attend between 6 and 10 sessions, but fewer or more sessions may be most suitable.
