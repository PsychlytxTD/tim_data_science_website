**"There is a candle in your heart, ready to be kindled.
There is a void in your soul, ready to be filled.
You feel it, don?t you?"** - Rumi

This page is dedicated to Effective Psychology, a private clinical psychology practice situated on the Mornington Peninsula that I established in January 2019. 

The aim of this page is to be simple, not to overwhelm you. If you have come this far, I congratulate you already. Many people could reach a happier place than their present one but choose not to.

Welcome.
