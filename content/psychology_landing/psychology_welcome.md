This page is about **Effective Psychology**, a private psychology practice established by Tim in January 2019 and situated south of Melbourne on the Mornington Peninsula.  


Having come this far, I congratulate you. Many people suffer silently and could reach a happier place, but choose not to.  


Welcome.
