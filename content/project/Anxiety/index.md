## Understanding the Need for Psychology  

People see a psychologist when they are experiencing some form of emotional suffering in their lives. Suffering happens in different ways. Some people notice that they feel down, flat or heavy a lot of the time. Others become aware that anxiety is impacting on their willingness to pursue what they love or on their ability make important decisions.

These days, it's normal to talk about someone having a *psychological disorder*. But I think it is more accurate o say that normal people sometimes experience  *disordered* events. That event might be an accident, a loss, a trauma. It doesn't matter. What matters is that the experiences can stay with us, influence us, and even undermine us. Until we make a choice to do something different...

Your psychologist will work with you to develop a shared understanding of what is driving your present difficulties. During the entire process, you will be treated with respect and empathy. After a path forward is established, your psychologist will draw upon principles and techniques from various modalities to assist you, including ISTDP, CBT, ACT and mindfulness. The approach depends on your particular needs and preferences. Most people complete between 6 and 10 sessions, but sometimes fewer or more appointments are appropriate.
