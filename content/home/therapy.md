**"Very little grows on jagged rock. Be ground. Be crumbled, so wild flowers will come up where you are."** - Rumi

Tim is an advocate for the transformative potential of good psychotherapy. 

He primarily practices Intensive Short-Term Intensive Psychotherapy (ISTDP), an approach that cuts to the heart of suffering.

 Sadly, great therapists can be hard to find, and Tim hopes to contribute towards change in how mental health professionals are trained.
